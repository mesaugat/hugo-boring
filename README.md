# hugo-boring

Boring is a minimal theme for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and is a fork of the feature-rich and highly customizable theme [Eureka](https://www.wangchucheng.com/en/docs/hugo-eureka/).

Boring is opinionated and is used for my [personal blog](https://theboring.dev).

## Try Boring

**Note of Caution**: I do not intend to add any extra features that are not going to be used in my personal blog. If you do want to extend the theme please fork the repository.
